# RoadToJunior

This is my own repository , where i track my own progress in Java programming, starting from absolute zero.

Here i collect my practice tasks, logic challanges.
Mini-projects: SmartLamp, CoffeeMachine, Ebook and SpetCounter.

## My goal
Build a fully functional Android app.

## Learning Status
This repository is a "live" log of my programming journey. I will be constantly updating and adding new projects, code samples, and Codewars solutions as i progress through my Java and OOP studies.
